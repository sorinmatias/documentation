Disable unused modules

TraceEnable off
  Disable Trace HTTP Request
  The default TraceEnable on permits TRACE, which disallows any request body to accompany the request. 
  TraceEnable off causes the core server and mod_proxy to return a 405 (Method not allowed) error to the client.
  TraceEnable on allows for Cross Site Tracing Issue and potentially giving the option to a hacker to steal your cookie 
  information.
  Solution: Address this security issue by disabling the TRACE HTTP method in Apache Configuration. You can do by
  Modifying/Adding below directive in your httpd.conf of your Apache Web Server.
 
User apache
Group apache
  It is good to run Apache in its own non-root account.Don’t set User (or Group) to root unless you know exactly
  what you are doing, and what the dangers are.
  
ServerSignature Off
  The Off setting, which is the default, suppresses the footer line. The On setting simply adds a line with the server 
  version number and ServerName of the serving virtual host.
  Solution: It’s good to disable Signature, as you may not wish to reveal Apache Version you are running.
  
ServerTokens Prod
  This directive controls whether Server response header field, which is sent back to clients, includes a description of 
  the generic OS-type of the server as well as information about compiled-in modules.
